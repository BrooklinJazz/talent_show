# Contribution Guidelines for DockYard Academy's Talent Show App

Thank you for considering contributing to DockYard Academy's Talent Show app! This document outlines how you can become part of our contributor community and help improve the app. Following these guidelines will help us streamline the collaboration process and ensure that your changes are quickly and easily integrated.

## What Can I Contribute?
You can help us in multiple ways: by reporting bugs, suggesting/implementing new features, optimizing code, or even writing documentation. We appreciate all types of contributions.

This project is for the students, graduates, and community members of DockYard Academy, so we will only accept contributions if you are already a member of that community.

## Steps to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repository:** Navigate to the Talent Show App repository on Github, click on the "Fork" button on the top right of the page. This creates a copy of the repository in your own Github account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

3. **Create a New Branch:** Always create a new branch for your changes. You can do this using the `git checkout -b branch-name` command. Try to name the branch as descriptively as possible, reflecting the changes you intend to make.

4. **Make Your Changes:** Make your changes in the code or documentation. Please follow the code style already established within the project. 

5. **Stage Your Changes:** Add your changes to be included in the next commit using the `git add .` command. This stages all changes in the current directory and subdirectories. If you prefer to add only specific files, use `git add file-name`.

6. **Commit Your Changes:** After you've made changes, commit them with a clear and concise commit message. This helps the project maintainers understand what changes you've made. Use `git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"`.

7. **Push Your Changes:** Push your changes to your forked repository on Github using `git push origin branch-name`. You may need to run `git push -u origin branch-name` if you have not already setup the upstream branch.

8. **Make a Pull Request (PR):** Go back to your forked repository on Github and click on "New pull request". On the next page, select your branch from the dropdown menu and confirm your changes. Then click on "Create pull request". Please provide a comprehensive description of the changes you've made.

## What Happens Next?
After you've submitted your pull request, the maintainers of the DockYard Academy's Talent Show app will review your changes. They may suggest some edits, improvements or clarification.

We also have a CI system that will run tests on your PR. Make sure these tests pass.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the DockYard Academy's Talent Show app. We look forward to your contribution!
